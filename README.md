# Ezamazwe Edutech Client

## Overview

This is a client facing app for Ezamazwe Edutech. This web application will allow users to have access to the online platform
where they can learn about topics under CAPS, IEB and Entrepreneurship. With this application Ezamazwe aims to reach more people 
that they may not be able to help on a normal work day. This will give students 24/7 access to learning content and tutors who are
well versed in topics that students need help in.

  2. Assuming you are using firebase to deploy, Run `firebase deploy`, the configuration file already exists, it will only need to be updated.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Integrations

The application communicates with a Node.js server that is hosted on Render at https://ezamazwe-edutech-nodejs.onrender.com.
The code can be found at https://github.com/codewithmokone/ezamazwe-edutech-nodejs

The pages that send http requests to the server are
  1. Registration page
     a. The page calls a function in the firebase.js utility file called registerUser
     b. The request sends a verification custom verification email that Ezamazwe can customise to always match their brand without any limits. 
  2. Verification page
     a. The page calls a function called handleEmailVerification
     b. The request sends the email and autogenerated code to the server for verification
  4. Forgot Password page
     a. The page calls a function in the AuthService.js utility file called ForgotPasswordFunction
     b. The request aims to allow Ezamazwe to have a custom password reset email that matches their brand and a reset page that matches not only their brand but also domains.
  5. Profile page
     a. The page makes a post request when the subscribed button is clicked 
     b. The request creates a redirect to payfast for payment
